# üåç Bridges from Borders ‚Äì AI-Powered Cultural Integration Platform

Empowering immigrants to overcome cultural and language barriers through intelligent translation, local support, and adaptive learning.

##  Project Overview

- Built an AI-driven platform using Hugging Face Transformers for dialect-aware translation across 30+ languages tailored to immigrant contexts.  
- Engineered **ConnectU**, a geolocation-based community connector leveraging graph clustering to link users with nearby immigrants for real-time support.  
- Developed a multilingual cultural adaptation chatbot using transformer-based models to guide users on local customs, essential services, and emergency protocols.  
- Designed interactive language learning tools for survival phrases and cultural etiquette, with gamified modules and contextual feedback.  
- Optimized for on-device inference and offline access in low-resource settings; tested across diverse user groups, achieving 4.2/5 in usability and a 43% faster adaptation score.
